SHMEM-Portals 0.1a
------------------

* About

SHMEM-Portals is an implementation of the OpenSHMEM 1.0 standard over
Portals 4.0.  The implementation is complete, although performance
tuning is still a work in progress.

* Deviations from the OpenSHMEM 1.0 draft

Where the OpenSHMEM draft and existing SHMEM implementations differ,
we general followed the OpenSHMEM draft.  In some cases, the draft
appeared to be in error, so we followed existing implementations:

  - shmem_*_g() functions return the remote data element as the return
    from the function, rather than storing it in addr.

* Building

This OpenSHMEM implementation utilizes the Autoconf/Automake/Libtool
build system.  The standard GNU configure script ane make system is
used to build OpenSHMEM Over Portals4.  To build:

  % ./configure <options>
  % make
  % make check
  % make install

The "make check" step is not strictly necessary, but is a good idea.

Options to configure include:

  --prefix=<DIR>        Install implementation in <DIR>
  --with-portals4=<DIR> Find the Portals4 library in <DIR>

* Portals 4 Support

Currently, only the shared memory reference implementation of Portals
4.0 is supported.  This list will expand over time.
