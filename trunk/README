SHMEM-Portals 0.1a
------------------

* About

SHMEM-Portals is an implementation of the OpenSHMEM 1.0 standard over
Portals 4.0.  The implementation is complete, although performance
tuning is still a work in progress.

* Building

This OpenSHMEM implementation utilizes the Autoconf/Automake/Libtool
build system.  The standard GNU configure script ane make system is
used to build OpenSHMEM Over Portals4.  To build:

  % ./configure <options>
  % make
  % make check
  % make install

The "make check" step is not strictly necessary, but is a good idea.

Options to configure include:

  --prefix=<DIR>        Install implementation in <DIR>
  --with-portals4=<DIR> Find the Portals4 library in <DIR>

* Portals 4 Support

Currently, only the shared memory reference implementation of Portals
4.0 is supported.  This list will expand over time.
