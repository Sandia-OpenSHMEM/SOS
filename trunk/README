Portals SHMEM
-------------

* About

Portals SHMEM is an implementation of the OpenSHMEM 1.0 standard over
Portals 4.0.  The implementation is complete, although performance
tuning is still a work in progress.


* Building

Portals SHMEM implementation utilizes the Autoconf/Automake/Libtool
build system.  The standard GNU configure script ane make system is
used to build OpenSHMEM Over Portals 4.  To build:

  % ./configure <options>
  % make
  % make check
  % make install

The "make check" step is not strictly necessary, but is a good idea.

Options to configure include:

  --prefix=<DIR>        Install implementation in <DIR>
  --with-portals4=<DIR> Find the Portals4 library in <DIR>


* Portals 4 Implementation Support

Portals SHMEM has only been tested with the following implementations
of the Portals 4.0 specification:

  - Shared memory reference implementation


* ToDo List

  - Modify collectives to use algorithms better than the current
    linear implementations
  - Fix shmem_{set, test, clear}_lock to not assume sizeof(long) is 8
  - Fix use of PTL_LONG to send long long types
  - Rational error messages in abort situations
  - Better error handling in dlmalloc code (don't raise sigabort)
  - Add long message optimization documented in report
