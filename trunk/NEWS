Portals SHMEM NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

1.0a4
-----
- Fixed shutdown cleanup problems identified by SFW.
- Fixed shmem_addr_accessible() to include the symmetric heap and the
  symmetric data section.
- Added configure option to remove counting event usage from wait and
  wait_until calls.
- Fixed a number of unprefixed global symbols.
- Fixed completion race condition in collective operations.

1.0a3
-----
- Only map data section (using data_start) instead of everything after
  the text section for the symmetric data region.
- Add ability to finalize library at exit.
- Added support for implementations without total data ordering,
  at the cost of shmem_fence() and shmem_quiet() being
  equivalent for those implementations.

1.0a2
-----
- Added --enable-error-checking option to configure to enable
  basic argument and usage checking inside the SHMEM library.  Off by
  default, as it negatively impacts performance.
- Added ability to use either MPI or the Portals over Shared Memory
  run-time to start parallel applications.
- Print (useful?) error message before aborting on error.

1.0a1
-----
- Intial public release.
