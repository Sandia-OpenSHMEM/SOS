Build all examples using "make" or "make all"

To build examples individually, use "make" followed by the filename (omitting the
file extension). For example, to build the hello world program, use "make hello"

To remove all the executables, run "make clean"

Requirments to build and run the examples:
  * Have the SOS installation "bin" directory set in the environment PATH
  * Have a compatible process launcher (e.g. Hydra version 3.2) set in the
    environment PATH
    * By invoking the run script, "oshrun", it will pick up the chosen process
      launcher.
  * An example of setting the environment PATH on bash:
    $ export PATH=<path-to-SOS-install>/bin:<path-to-hydra-install>/bin:$PATH

The hello world example can be run with 4 processes, as below: 
  oshrun -n 4 ./hello
