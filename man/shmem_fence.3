.SS API Description

This routine assures ordering of delivery of PUT, AMO, memory store, and nonblocking PUT
routines to symmetric data objects. All PUT, AMO, memory store, and nonblocking PUT
routines to symmetric data objects issued to a particular remote PE 
on the given context prior
to the call to 
.B shmem\_fence
are guaranteed to be delivered before any
subsequent PUT, AMO, memory store, and nonblocking PUT routines to symmetric data
objects to the same PE. 
.B shmem\_fence
guarantees order of delivery,
not completion. It does not guarantee order of delivery of nonblocking GET routines.

.SS Return Values

None.

.SS API Notes

.B shmem\_fence
only provides per-PE ordering guarantees and does not
guarantee completion of delivery. 
.B shmem\_fence
also does not have an effect on the ordering between memory 
accesses issued by the target PE. 
.BR "shmem\_wait\_until" ,
.BR "shmem\_test" ,
.BR "shmem\_barrier" ,
.B shmem\_barrier\_all
routines can be called by the target PE to guarantee 
ordering of its memory accesses.
There is a subtle difference between
.B shmem\_fence
and 
.BR "shmem\_quiet" ,
in that, 
.B shmem\_quiet
guarantees completion of PUT, AMO, memory store, and nonblocking PUT routines to
symmetric data objects which makes the updates visible to all other
PEs. 

The 
.B shmem\_quiet
routine should be called if completion of PUT,
AMO, memory store, and nonblocking PUT routines to symmetric data objects is desired
when multiple remote PEs are involved.

In an OpenSHMEM program with multithreaded PEs, it is the
user's responsibility to ensure ordering between operations issued by the threads
in a PE that target symmetric memory (e.g. PUT, AMO, memory stores,
and nonblocking routines) and calls by threads in that PE to
.BR "shmem\_fence" .
The 
.B shmem\_fence
routine can enforce memory store ordering only for the
calling thread. Thus, to ensure ordering for memory stores performed by a thread that is
not the thread calling 
.BR "shmem\_fence" ,
the update must be made visible to the
calling thread according to the rules of the memory model associated with
the threading environment.

.SS Examples



The following example uses 
.B shmem\_fence
in a C[11] program: 

.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <shmem.h>

int main(void)
{
  int src = 99;
  long source[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
  static long dest[10];
  static int targ;
  shmem_init();
  int me = shmem_my_pe();
  if (me == 0) {
     shmem_put(dest, source, 10, 1); /* put1 */
     shmem_put(dest, source, 10, 2); /* put2 */
     shmem_fence();
     shmem_put(&targ, &src, 1, 1); /* put3 */
     shmem_put(&targ, &src, 1, 2); /* put4 */
  }
  shmem_barrier_all();  /* sync sender and receiver */
  printf("dest[0] on PE %d is %ld\\n", me, dest[0]);
  shmem_finalize();
  return 0;
}
.fi

.I Put1
will be ordered to be delivered before 
.I put3
and 
.I put2
will be ordered to be delivered before 
.IR "put4" .
