.SH NAME
shmem_finalize \- 
A collective operation that releases resources used by the OpenSHMEM
library. This only terminates the OpenSHMEM portion of a program, not the
entire program.

.SS API Description
.B shmem\_finalize
is a collective operation that ends the OpenSHMEM
portion of a program previously initialized by 
.B shmem\_init
and
releases resources used by the OpenSHMEM library. This collective
operation requires all PEs to participate in the call. There is an
implicit global barrier in 
.B shmem\_finalize
so that pending
communications are completed, and no resources can be released until all
PEs have entered 
.BR "shmem\_finalize" .
.B shmem\_finalize
must be
the last OpenSHMEM library call encountered in the OpenSHMEM portion of a
program. A call to 
.B shmem\_finalize
will release any resources
initialized by a corresponding call to 
.BR "shmem\_init" .
All processes
that represent the PEs will still exist after the
call to 
.B shmem\_finalize
returns, but they will no longer have access
to any resources that have been released.

.SS Return Values
None.

.SS API Notes
.B shmem\_finalize
releases all resources used by the OpenSHMEM library
including the symmetric memory heap and pointers initiated by
.BR "shmem\_ptr" .
This collective operation requires all PEs to
participate in the call, not just a subset of the PEs. The
non-OpenSHMEM portion of a program may continue after a call to
.B shmem\_finalize
by all PEs. There is an implicit
.B shmem\_finalize
at the end of main, so that having an explicit call
to 
.B shmem\_finalize
is optional. However, an explicit
.B shmem\_finalize
may be required as an entry point for wrappers used
by profiling or other tools that need to perform their own finalization.

.SS Examples
The following finalize example is for C11 programs:
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <shmem.h> 
int main(void)
{
  static long x = 10101;
  long y = -1;
  shmem_init();
  int me = shmem_my_pe();
  int npes = shmem_n_pes();
  if (me == 0)
     y = shmem_g(&x, npes-1);
  printf("%d: y = %ld\\n", me, y); 
  shmem_finalize();  
  return 0;
}
.fi
