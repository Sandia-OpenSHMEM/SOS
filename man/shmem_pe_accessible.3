.SS API Description

.B shmem\_pe\_accessible
is a query routine that indicates whether a
specified PE is accessible via OpenSHMEM from the local PE. The
.B shmem\_pe\_accessible
routine returns a value indicating whether the remote
PE is a process running from the same executable file as the local
PE, thereby indicating whether full support for symmetric data objects,
which may reside in either static memory or the symmetric heap, is available.

.SS Return Values

The return value is 1 if the specified PE is a valid remote PE
for OpenSHMEM routines; otherwise, it is 0.

.SS API Notes

This routine may be particularly useful for hybrid programming with other
communication libraries (such as MPI) or parallel languages. For
example, when an MPI job uses Multiple Program Multiple Data (MPMD) mode, multiple executable
MPI programs are executed as part of the same MPI job. In such cases,
OpenSHMEM support may only be available between processes running from the
same executable file. In addition, some environments may allow a hybrid
job to span multiple network partitions. In such scenarios, OpenSHMEM
support may only be available between PEs within the same partition.
