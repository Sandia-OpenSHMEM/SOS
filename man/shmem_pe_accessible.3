.SS API Description

.B shmem\_pe\_accessible
is a query routine that indicates whether a
specified PE is accessible via OpenSHMEM from the local PE. The
.B shmem\_pe\_accessible
routine returns TRUE only if the remote
PE is a process running from the same executable file as the local
PE, indicating that full OpenSHMEM support for symmetric data objects
(that reside in the static memory and symmetric heap) is available, otherwise it
returns FALSE. This routine may be particularly useful for hybrid
programming with other communication libraries (such as a MPI) or parallel
languages. For example, on SGI Altix series systems, OpenSHMEM is
supported across multiple partitioned hosts and InfiniBand connected hosts.
When running multiple executable MPI programs using OpenSHMEM on an Altix, full
OpenSHMEM support is available between processes running from the same
executable file. However, OpenSHMEM support between processes of different
executable files is supported only for data objects on the symmetric heap,
since static data objects are not symmetric between different executable
files.

.SS Return Values

C/C++: The return value is 1 if the specified PE is a valid remote PE
for OpenSHMEM routines; otherwise, it is 0. 



Fortran: The return value is .TRUE. if the specified PE is a valid
remote PE for OpenSHMEM routines; otherwise, it is .FALSE..
