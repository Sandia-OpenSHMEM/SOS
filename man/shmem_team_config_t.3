.SS API Description

A team configuration object is provided as an argument to
.B shmem\_team\_split\_*
routines.
It specifies the requested capabilities of the team to be
created.

The 
.I num\_contexts
member specifies the total number of simultaneously
existing contexts that the program requests to create from this team.
These contexts may be created in any number of threads. Successful
creation of a team configured with 
.I num\_contexts
of N means
that the implementation will make a best effort to reserve enough
resources to support N contexts created from the team
in existance at any given time. It is not a guaruntee that N
calls to 
.B shmem\_team\_create\_ctx
will succeed.
See
.B shmem\_ctx\_create
for more on communication contexts and
.B shmem\_team\_create\_ctx
for team-based context creation.

When using the configuration structure to create teams, a mask parameter
controls which fields may be accessed by the OpenSHMEM library.
Any configuration parameter value that is not indicated in the mask will be
ignored, and the default value will be used instead.
Therefore, a program must only set the fields for which it does not want the default value.

A configuration mask is created through a bitwise OR operation of the
following library constants.
A configuration mask value of 0 indicates that the team
should be created with the default values for all configuration
parameters.


./ sectionStart
.TP 25
SHMEM\_TEAM\_NUM\_CONTEXTS
The team should be created using the value of the
.I num\_contexts
member of the configuration parameter
.I config
as a requirement. 
./ sectionEnd


The default values for configuration parameters are:
./ sectionStart
.TP 25
.I num\_contexts = 0
By default, no contexts can be created on a new team
