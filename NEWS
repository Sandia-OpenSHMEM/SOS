Sandia OpenSHMEM NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

v1.5.2rc1
---------

- Added support for the CXI libfabric provider, enabling SOS on the Slingshot
  interconnect.  Setup instructions are on SOS's Github wiki.
- Added support for shmem_team_ptr routine.
- Added support for negatives strides in the OpenSHMEM teams APIs.
- Added checks for incorrect buffer overlap when error-checking is enabled.
- Added a configure option to enable deprecated tests,
  --enable-deprecated-tests, which is disabled by default.

  SHMEMX_MALLOC_NO_BARRIER, which removes the barrier at exit from the routine.
  Users must synchronize appropriately after such an operation.
- Initialized the OFI tx/rx capabilities appropriately to limit what is enabled
  by providers. This resolves an issue with the Omni-Path Express (opx) provider.
- Patched the symmetric data segment initialization to better support MacOS.

v1.5.1
------

- Added a Dockerfile so users can create containers that provide a configurable
  Ubuntu sandbox for running SOS applications and benchmarks.

v1.5.1rc1
---------

- Added deprecation warnings for shmem_barrier, active-set reductions, and
  other deprecated routines, such as the 32/64-bit collectives.
- Removed usage of deprecated APIs in shmem_perf_suite, apps, and spec-examples
- Added missing types for the OpenSHMEM v1.5 reductions (e.g., fixed-width
  integers, ptrdiff_t, size_t, and schar).
- Fixed an incorrect function signature for shmem_team_get_config().
- Resolved some critical issues with the UCX transport.
- Updated upstream configuration scripts from OpenMPI for UCX, PMI, etc.
- Fixed issues with the OpenSHMEM teams API (e.g. team-based broadcasts now
  update the destination object on all PEs including the root).
- Corrected the return value for shmem_test_all and shmem_test_all_vector.
- Added support for shmem_signal_wait_until.
- Resolved a critical build issue on Mac OSX.

  test suite benchmarks, configurable by environment variable,
  SHMEM_PERF_SUITE_TRIALS_MULTIPLIER.
- Added {SOS base}/examples directory with simple OpenSHMEM example programs
  and instructions on how to build and run those.
- With the recent fixes in libfabric 1.11.x, RXM/Verbs provider support does
  not require setting the FI_MR_CACHE_MAX_COUNT environment variable to 0
  when threading is used.
- Additional bugfixes, including profiling symbols for some team-based
  collectives, support for C99 compilation, and unit test failures
  with single PE.

v1.5.0rc1
---------
- Support for OpenSHMEM v1.5 specification
- New features include: a teams API and teams-based collectives,
  put-with-signal routines, nonblocking atomic routines, multiple-element
  wait/test vector comparison routines, shmem_malloc_with_hints, and a
  profiling interface.  See OpenSHMEM 1.5 Specification, Annex G for details.
- Deprecations include: active-set-based library constants and collective
  routines, shmem_barrier, and short/unsigned short variants for
  shmem_wait_until and shmem_test.  See OpenSHMEM 1.5 Specification, Annex F
  for details.
- Added support for UCX transport
- Added shmem_malloc_with_hints. Currently, no hint values are supported.
- Added shmem_signal_fetch
- Multiple bugfixes, including in teams resource management, put completion
  logic, and configure issues when multiple transports are detected.

v1.4.5
------
- Added a complete OpenSHMEM teams API to the shmemx interfaces.
- Added the OpenSHMEM wait/test vector API to the shmemx interfaces.
- Added support for shared memory atomic operations with the appropriate
  acquire/release memory ordering where required.  This feature requires
  the --enable-shr-transport build flag.
- Improved experimental support for the RXM/Verbs provider stack with
  libfabric 1.8 and newer.
- Updated SOS to use the new OFI memory registration mode flags instead of
  the deprecated FI_MR_SCALABLE/FI_MR_BASIC modes.

  recent changes to the OpenSHMEM specification.
- Added a memory sync before returning from barriers to ensure shared memory
  updates and remote updates cached in the NIC are visible in memory.
- Updated the utility atomics (spinlocks and counters) to use __atomic built-in
  functions rather than the deprecated __sync builtins.
- Removed redundant shmem_barrier_all from the GUPS example application.
- Moved unit tests derived from OpenSHMEM specification examples to the
  test/spec-example directory.

v1.4.4
------
- Experimental support for RXM/Verbs provider stack with libfabric 1.8.
  Requires --enable-hard-polling and --enable-ofi-mr=basic build flags.  The
  FI_MR_CACHE_MAX_COUNT environment variable should be set to 0 when threading
  is used.  Depending on the libfabric build, setting
  SHMEM_OFI_PROVIDER="verbs;ofi_rxm" may be necessary to select the provider.
- Rewrite of node-level detection/management to enable improvements in on-node
  communication and resource management.
- Added bandwidth optimized ring reduction algorithm, selectable by setting the
  SHMEM_REDUCE_ALGORITHM environment variable to "ring".  See README for
  details.
- Added the SHMEM_COLL_SIZE_CROSSOVER environment variable to control the
  message size at which collective communication transitions between latency
  and bandwidth optimization.
- Added SHMEM_OFI_STX_AUTO environment variable to enable automatic
  partitioning of STX resources on node.  See README for details.
- Updated unit tests and performance test suite to properly handle failed
  context creation.
- Updated OFI transport to support providers that do not support the
  FI_SHARED_CONTEXT TX attribute (STX) on endpoints.
- Updated OFI transport to bind a CQ to the target EP (required by some
  providers) and poll the target CQ when driving manual progress.  As a result,
  manual progress no longer requries a target-side counter and can be used in
  conjunction with hard polling.
- Added support for decimal values in the SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_SIZE environment
  variable (e.g., 1.5G).
- Updated shmem_init_thread routine to return an error when library
  initialization fails (e.g., due to invalid SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_SIZE value).
- Fixed argument/context handling in Mandelbrot example program.
- Improved handling of context creation failure.
- Added missing pshmem_global_exit symbol to profiling interfaces.
- Updated shmem_ptr to return a pointer for the local process, even when
  inter-PE shared memory is not enabled.

  SHMEMX_CTX_INVALID.
- Additional bugfixes and improvement (see git log for details).

- Added put-with-signal optimization that uses the FI_FENCE capability (see
  --enable-ofi-fence for details).
- Added support for backtrace printing when SOS aborts (see SHMEM_BACKTRACE
  environment variable for details).
- OFI transport merged cntr and cq endpoints, improving resource utilization.
- Fixed issue with missing pshmem symbols in proposed profiling interfaces.
- Improved support for SLURM using PMI-1.
- Unit tests for the C++ generic interfaces (currently an SOS extension) were
  moved to the "test/shmemx" directory and context creation failure handling
  was improved in all tests to improve portability of the SOS test suite.
- Constant and type declarations were moved from shmem.h to shmem-def.h to
  eliminate dependence of pshmem.h and shmemx.h on shmem.h

v1.4.2
------
