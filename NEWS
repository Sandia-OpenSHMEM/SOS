Sandia OpenSHMEM NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

v1.4.1rc1
---------
- Added multi-threaded implementations of the shmem_perf_suite throughput
  benchmarks, which make use of OpenSHMEM contexts and OpenMP.
- Modified the test suite to enable building and running external to the SOS
  repository (see https://github.com/openshmem-org/tests-sos).
- Provided a pkg-config file for Sandia OpenSHMEM named 'sos'.
- Added the SHMEM_OFI_STX_DISABLE_PRIVATE mode which disables STX
  privatization, potentially improving load balance across transmit resources.
- Improved the portability of SOS's error-reporting utilities.
- Introduced support for the shmem_query_thread routine.
- Added an optional probe routine to assist OFI transport progress (see
  --enable-manual-progress), which may improve the performance of pending
  communication operations for some providers (notably, PSM2).
- Added the shmemx_register_gettid function, which allows users to pass a
  function pointer for setting custom thread IDs.
- Added the --disable-aslr-check options to disable the check for address space
  layout randomization.
- Added a unit test to validate the memory barriers in various SOS
  synchronization routines.
- Multiple bugfixes in the unit tests, performance suite, Portals finalization,
  OFI STX management, the SOS simple build script, the default poll limit, and
  more.


v1.4.0
------
- Support for OpenSHMEM 1.4 specification.
- New features include: Thread safety, communication management API (contexts),
  test routines, sync routines, calloc for symmetric objects, bitwise atomic
  operations, and updated C11 generic selection bindings.  See OpenSHMEM 1.4
  Specification, Annex G for details.
- Deprecations include: Fortran API, shmem_wait routines, mpp header directory,
  and SMA-prefixed environment variables.  See OpenSHMEM 1.4 Specification,
  Annex F for details.
- Added support for OFI FI_THREAD_COMPLETION thread safety model, needed to use
  the SHMEM_THREAD_MULTIPLE mode with the PSM2 provider and others (see
  --enable-thread-completion).  For providers that support FI_THREAD_SAFE, this
  mode may also provider better performance for private and serialized
  contexts.

- Added support to OFI transport for sharing STX resources across contexts.
- Added several environment variables that can be used to control STX resource
  management in the OFI transport: SHMEM_OFI_STX_MAX, SHMEM_OFI_STX_ALLOCATOR,
  and SHMEM_OFI_STX_THRESHOLD.  See README for details.
- Updated data segment exposure method to improve compatibility with tools.
- Updated thread safety support in Portals transport, eliminating several
  possible races in communication tracking/completion code.

---------
- Added support to OFI transport for sharing STX resources across contexts.

  in communication tracking/completion code.

v1.4.0rc1
---------

- Added support for OFI FI_THREAD_COMPLETION thread safety model, needed to use
  the SHMEM_THREAD_MULTIPLE mode with the PSM2 provider and others (see
  --enable-thread-completion).  For providers that support FI_THREAD_SAFE, this
  mode may also provider better performance for private and serialized
  contexts.
- Added manpages for OpenSHMEM 1.4 API routines.

  test routines, sync routines, calloc for symmetric objects, bitwise atomic
  operations, and updated C11 generic selection bindings.
- Deprecations include: Fortran API, shmem_wait routines, mpp header directory,
  and SMA-prefixed environment variables.
- This is an alpha release; full API support is provided, but the
  implementation may contain bugs and is not yet optimized for performance.

v1.3.4
------
- Added manpages for OpenSHMEM API routines.
- Added polling limit control variables SMA_OFI_TX_POLL_LIMIT and
  SMA_OFI_RX_POLL_LIMIT (see README for details) to allow control over quiet
  and wait polling limits, respectively.
- Rewrite of environment variable management code and improved info output.
- Added support for processor atomics in thread-safe build.
- Added support for local communication optimization (--enable-memcpy).
