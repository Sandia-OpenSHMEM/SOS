Sandia OpenSHMEM NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

v1.5.0rc1
---------
- Renamed all OpenSHMEM v1.5 interfaces from "shmemx" to "shmem" and moved all unit tests accordingly
- Added support for UCX Transport
- Added shmem_malloc_with_hints(though no hints supported yet)
- Added shmem_signal_fetch

v1.4.5
------
- Added a complete OpenSHMEM teams API to the shmemx interfaces.
- Added the OpenSHMEM wait/test vector API to the shmemx interfaces.
- Added support for shared memory atomic operations with the appropriate
  acquire/release memory ordering where required.  This feature requires
  the --enable-shr-transport build flag.
- Improved experimental support for the RXM/Verbs provider stack with
  libfabric 1.8 and newer.
- Updated SOS to use the new OFI memory registration mode flags instead of
  the deprecated FI_MR_SCALABLE/FI_MR_BASIC modes.
- Updated the wait/test any/all/some "status" array semantics to reflect
  recent changes to the OpenSHMEM specification.
- Added a memory sync before returning from barriers to ensure shared memory
  updates and remote updates cached in the NIC are visible in memory.
- Updated the utility atomics (spinlocks and counters) to use __atomic built-in
  functions rather than the deprecated __sync builtins.
- Removed redundant shmem_barrier_all from the GUPS example application.
- Moved unit tests derived from OpenSHMEM specification examples to the
  test/spec-example directory.

v1.4.4
------
- Experimental support for RXM/Verbs provider stack with libfabric 1.8.
  Requires --enable-hard-polling and --enable-ofi-mr=basic build flags.  The
  FI_MR_CACHE_MAX_COUNT environment variable should be set to 0 when threading
  is used.  Depending on the libfabric build, setting
  SHMEM_OFI_PROVIDER="verbs;ofi_rxm" may be necessary to select the provider.
- Rewrite of node-level detection/management to enable improvements in on-node
  communication and resource management.
- Added bandwidth optimized ring reduction algorithm, selectable by setting the
  SHMEM_REDUCE_ALGORITHM environment variable to "ring".  See README for
  details.
- Added the SHMEM_COLL_SIZE_CROSSOVER environment variable to control the
  message size at which collective communication transitions between latency
  and bandwidth optimization.
- Added SHMEM_OFI_STX_AUTO environment variable to enable automatic
  partitioning of STX resources on node.  See README for details.
- Updated unit tests and performance test suite to properly handle failed
  context creation.
- Updated OFI transport to support providers that do not support the
  FI_SHARED_CONTEXT TX attribute (STX) on endpoints.
- Updated OFI transport to bind a CQ to the target EP (required by some
  providers) and poll the target CQ when driving manual progress.  As a result,
  manual progress no longer requries a target-side counter and can be used in
  conjunction with hard polling.
- Added support for decimal values in the SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_SIZE environment
  variable (e.g., 1.5G).
- Updated shmem_init_thread routine to return an error when library
  initialization fails (e.g., due to invalid SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_SIZE value).
- Fixed argument/context handling in Mandelbrot example program.
- Improved handling of context creation failure.
- Added missing pshmem_global_exit symbol to profiling interfaces.
- Updated shmem_ptr to return a pointer for the local process, even when
  inter-PE shared memory is not enabled.
- Updated fence, quiet, and context destroy to perform no operation for
  SHMEMX_CTX_INVALID.
- Additional bugfixes and improvement (see git log for details).

v1.4.3
------
- Added NBI atomics support to performance suite benchmarks.
- Fixed shmem_ctx_t type compatibility with C++ and older C compilers.

v1.4.3rc1
---------
- Added proposed OpenSHMEM put-with-signal routines to shmemx interaces.

- Added proposed OpenSHMEM nonblocking fetching atomic operations to shmemx
  interfaces.
- Added proposed OpenSHMEM SHMEM_CTX_INVALID constant to shmemx interfaces.
- Added put-with-signal optimization that uses the FI_FENCE capability (see
  --enable-ofi-fence for details).
- Added support for backtrace printing when SOS aborts (see SHMEM_BACKTRACE
  environment variable for details).
- OFI transport merged cntr and cq endpoints, improving resource utilization.
- Fixed issue with missing pshmem symbols in proposed profiling interfaces.
- Improved support for SLURM using PMI-1.
- Unit tests for the C++ generic interfaces (currently an SOS extension) were
  moved to the "test/shmemx" directory and context creation failure handling
  was improved in all tests to improve portability of the SOS test suite.
- Constant and type declarations were moved from shmem.h to shmem-def.h to
  eliminate dependence of pshmem.h and shmemx.h on shmem.h

v1.4.2
------

  over atomic operations.
- Updated manual progress to automatically enable completion polling.
