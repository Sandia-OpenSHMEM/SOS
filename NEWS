Sandia OpenSHMEM NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

v1.3.2
------
- Improved support for proposed multithreading extension (see shmemx.h),
  enabled at compile time via --enable-threads.
- Enabled single-process, direct execution of SOS binaries with simple PMI.
- Added argument error checking for all SHMEM routines, enabled at compile time
  via --enable-error-checking.
- Multiple build system improvements, including support for VPATH builds.
- Added new C and Fortran bindings generator that generates all headers and
  bindings, including profiling interfaces.
- Added support for Fortran complex reductions API.
- Updated Fortran bindings to use short (OpenSHMEM style) header by default.
- Updated SHMEM_DEBUG output to include detailed build information.
- Added --enable-completion-polling build option to poll in quiet/fence
  operations rather than waiting.  This can improve performance for libfabric
  providers that require software-generated progress.
- Added --disable-bounce-buffers build option to disable bounce buffering by
  default (i.e. set SHMEM_BOUNCE_SIZE to 0 by default).
- Improved library path propagation (rpath) in compiler wrappers.
- Improved PMI simple build and fixed integration of libpmi_simple library.
- Update symmetric heap allocator to dlmalloc v2.8.6.
- Update PMI-1 client library from MPICH.
- Improved bandwidth efficiency and fixed bug in collect routines.
- Fixed several bugs in tree-based collectives when using PE active sets.
- Fixed several bugs in recursive-doubling reduction routine when using PE
  active sets and when source and target buffers overlap.
- Fixed synchronization bug in memory management routines.

1.3.1
-----
- Support for allocating the symmetric heap using Linux huge pages.
- Improved support for Cray XC platforms.
- Improved support for variations in atomics support across OFI providers.
- Initial support for thread safety in the OFI transport.
- Fix several issues with C/C++ bindings and profiling interface.
- Added new benchmarks, unit tests, and examples.

1.3.0
-----
- Support for OpenSHMEM 1.3 specification, including nonblocking communication,
  fetch/set atomics, all-to-all collectives, C11 generic bindings, and addition
  of const/volatile to C API.
- Improvements to error checking of OpenSHMEM calls and internal debugging
  enabled through --enable-error-checking configure option.
- Improvements to C++ compatibility, including support for type-generic
  bindings in C++.
- Support for fabric and domain selection in the OFI transport, see
  SMA_OFI_DOMAIN/FABRIC environment variables in the README file for details.
- Support for systems using the Aries network via the OFI GNI provider.
- Enabled XPMEM support in combination with the OFI transport.
- Support for PMI2-compliant process managers.
- The OFI transport automatically falls back to software reductions when the
  provider does not support the particular combination of atomic operation and
  datatype for a given OpenSHMEM reduction.
- Added multiple communication performance benchmarks to the test suite.
- Multiple bug fixes and improvements to stability and performance.

1.2.0
-----
- Support for OpenSHMEM 1.2 specification
- Support for libfabric
- Integrated support for PMI-1 compliant launcher (e.g. MPICH Hydra)
- Build now generates 'oshrun' launcher script for launching OpenSHMEM applications
- Multiple bug fixes and improvements to stability and performance
- Add shmemx.h and shmemx.fh header files for Sandia OpenSHMEM extensions
- Add support for short, SGI-style Fortran header (configure option
  --disable-long-fortran-header) required by UH test suite
- Removed stale copies of UH tests, upstreamed changes, and moved to external
  testing model.  Extensive bug fixes and improvements to remaining test suite.

1.0a8
-----
- Initial public release
