"Simple" PMI-1 client library:
==============================

This directory contains the "simple" PMI-1 process manager interface (PMI)
client implementation from MPICH, located at the following URL.

https://github.com/pmodels/mpich/tree/master/src/pmi/simple

This PMI-1 client implementation is compatible with many PMI-1 compliant
process managers.  In particular, it can be used with the Hydra process
manager, which is available as a component in MPICH or as a standalone package
at the following URL.

http://www.mpich.org/downloads/

This PMI client library can be enabled in the SOS build at configuration time
by passing the --enable-pmi-simple.


Modifying and maintaining these files:
======================================

Local modifications should be kept to a minimum and any bugfixes should be
pushed upstream to MPICH.  Some modifications are necessary to integrate this
code with SOS.  These modifications should ideally be isolated in the local
"mpl.h" and autoconf generated "config.h" headers.

Periodically, we synchronize these files with MPICH.  This can generally be
accomplished by copying the source files from the MPICH repository at the above
URL and commenting out inclusions of missing headers (at the time of writing,
"mpi.h" and "mpir_mem.h").
