=============
OpenPA v1.0.3
=============
Major Changes:
      * Libtool shared library support for OPA, avoiding shared/static mixed linking problems on some platforms.
      * The build system should now work more portably with broken/exotic shells.
      * pkg-config support
      * Emulated atomics can now be detected by the presence of an OPA_EXPLICIT_EMULATION #define in opa_config.h.
      * PPC types are now correctly aligned to 8 bytes instead of 16 bytes.
      * many more tests for "make check", fixed missing memory barriers in one test
